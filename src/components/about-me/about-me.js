      <h3 className="b-about-me__subtitle">What can I do for you</h3>
      <p>I started as a freelance doing both design and code, yet the last years I focused my career in the latest. That gave me a special point of view and understanding of how a concept or idea should be implemented from its inception to the final delivery to the end user.</p>
      <p>What's the right approach. Which are the right tools. How you can make the best out of a project in terms of development so you don't end up with an unmaintainable nightmare in the future. A solid foundation with a proper <strong>Design System</strong> will help your day to day workflow, reducing time and effort, and assuring a cohesive and visually strong brand and look and feel.</p>
      <p>And to achieve that I'm comfortable working with different stakeholders, from Design and Content teams to the Engineering ones, speaking their languages and finding the right solutions, and since I'm a frontend developer I can write the code myself. No more crazy requirements that ultimately can't be delivered. Less surprises equals less frustration and better products.</p>

      <h4 className="b-about-me__note-title">Things I do when I'm not coding</h4>
      <p>I enjoy life off screen, doing photography (you can check my <a href="https://instagram.com/jeroenwtf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>), playing music or hiking and climbing.</p>
